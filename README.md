## ✨ Key Features

* **Adaptive Lighting:** Dynamically adjusts LED brightness based on real-time ambient light (LDR) and motion detection (PIR/IR sensors), reducing energy waste.
* **Real-time Fault Detection:** Monitors and reports anomalies in power, network connectivity, sensors, and LED panels, minimizing downtime and streamlining maintenance.
* **Dual-Communication Architecture:** Uses Wi-Fi for high-bandwidth urban deployments and LoRaWAN for long-range, low-power highway and rural applications.
* **High Energy Efficiency:** Achieves up to 80% reduction in energy consumption compared to traditional static street lighting systems.
* **Cost-Effective & Modular:** Built using the ESP32 Devkit V1 and common sensors, making the solution accessible and scalable.
* **Cloud-Based Monitoring:** Uploads real-time operational data and fault alerts to a cloud platform for centralized control.
